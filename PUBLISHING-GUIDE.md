---

## üé® Step 1: Prepare Visual Assets

### Plugin Icon (Required)
**Size**: 128√ó128px PNG  
**Guidelines**:
- Simple, recognizable design
- Works at small sizes
- Transparent or solid background
- Represents your plugin's purpose

**Example for Sitemap Builder**:
- Icon idea: Hierarchy tree structure or connected boxes
- Colors: Blue (#18A0FB - Figma brand color) and white
- Style: Minimal, modern

### Cover Image (Required)
**Size**: 1920√ó960px  
**Guidelines**:
- Showcases your plugin in action
- High quality, professional looking
- Shows before/after or key features
- Can include text overlay

**For Sitemap Builder**:
- Show a sitemap being created from text
- Split screen: text editor on left, visual sitemap on right
- Title: "Build Visual Sitemaps from Text"

### Screenshots (Recommended 3-5)
**Size**: Flexible, but high resolution  
**Show**:
1. Main plugin interface
2. Sitemap creation in progress
3. Final sitemap result
4. Export to Figma feature
5. Example use case

---

## üîß Step 2: Update Plugin Manifest

### Current Manifest Issues

Your current `manifest.json` has a placeholder ID. You need to update it:

**Current**:
```json
{
  "name": "Sitemap Builder",
  "id": "1234567892",
  "api": "1.0.0",
  "main": "code.js",
  "ui": "ui.html",
  "editorType": ["figjam", "figma"]
}
```

### Required Changes

1. **Generate Unique Plugin ID**
   - IDs are 10-13 digit numbers
   - Must be unique
   - Generated automatically when you first publish
   - Can use a random number for now: `1234567890123`

2. **Add Metadata for Community**

**Updated manifest.json**:
```json
{
  "name": "Sitemap Builder",
  "id": "1234567890123",
  "api": "1.0.0",
  "main": "code.js",
  "ui": "ui.html",
  "editorType": ["figjam", "figma"],
  "networkAccess": {
    "allowedDomains": [
      "https://api.allorigins.win"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Required for website import feature - fetches sitemap.xml and crawls websites to build sitemap structure"
  }
}
```

**Note**: The `networkAccess` field is REQUIRED because your plugin uses `fetch()` for website import.

---

## üìù Step 3: Write Plugin Description

### Short Description (for listing)
**150 characters max**

"Create visual website sitemaps from indented text. Import from websites, export to design frames. Perfect for IA planning and collaboration."

---

## üìã Step 5: Figma Review Process

### What Happens Next

1. **Automated Checks** (Instant)
   - Manifest validation
   - Code security scan
   - Asset quality check

2. **Human Review** (1-5 business days)
   - Figma team reviews your plugin
   - Checks against community guidelines
   - Tests functionality
   - Reviews description and assets

3. **Approval or Feedback**
   - **Approved**: Plugin goes live immediately
   - **Needs Changes**: You'll get specific feedback
   - **Rejected**: Explanation provided (rare)

### Common Rejection Reasons

- ‚ùå Poor quality assets (blurry images, bad icon)
- ‚ùå Misleading description
- ‚ùå Broken functionality or bugs
- ‚ùå Violates Figma's terms of service
- ‚ùå Similar to existing plugin (must differentiate)
- ‚ùå Security concerns with code
- ‚ùå Missing network access disclosure

---

## üîí Step 6: Security & Privacy Review

### Your Plugin Uses Network Access

Because your plugin fetches data from websites, Figma will scrutinize:

**‚úÖ What's Good**:
- Clear `networkAccess` declaration in manifest
- Uses public CORS proxy (allorigins.win)
- No collection of user data
- No external tracking or analytics

**‚ö†Ô∏è Be Ready to Explain**:
- Why network access is needed (website import feature)
- What domains are accessed
- What data is transmitted
- How user privacy is protected

**In Your Review Response**:
```
Network Access Justification:

The plugin uses network access solely for the "Import from Website" 
feature, which allows users to import sitemap structures from live 
websites. This feature:

1. Fetches sitemap.xml files via CORS proxy (api.allorigins.win)
2. Optionally crawls public website pages (user-initiated)
3. Processes data locally in the browser
4. Does not store, transmit, or track any user data
5. Does not collect analytics or telemetry

Users can create sitemaps entirely offline using the text editor - 
network access is optional and only used when explicitly requested 
by the user via the "Import from Web" button.

The CORS proxy is necessary because browsers block direct cross-origin 
requests. We use a public, trusted proxy service.
```
